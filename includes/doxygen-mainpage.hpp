 * \section intro_sec Introduction
 *
 * WindFlow is a C++17 library for parallel data stream processing applications targeting heterogeneous shared-memory architectures
 * featuring multi-core CPUs and GPU devices. The library provides common stream processing operators like map, flatmap, filter,
 * fold/reduce as well as sliding-window operators designed with complex parallel features. Applications are built through the
 * MultiPipe and the PipeGraph programming constructs. The first is used to create parallel pipelines, while the second one allows
 * several MultiPipe instances to be interconnected through merge and split operations.
