 *
 *  @section Shipper (Description)
 *
 *  This file implements the Shipper class used to send produced output results
 *  to the next stage of the application.
 *
 *  The template parameter of the data items that can be used with the Shipper must be default
 *  constructible, with a copy Constructor and copy assignment operator, and they
 *  must provide and implement the setControlFields() and getControlFields() methods.
